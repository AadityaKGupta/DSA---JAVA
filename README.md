# DSA-JAVA
This repository provides Java implementations for fundamental data structures and algorithms, organized into the following categories:

Arrays
Description: Arrays are collections of elements identified by index or key. This section covers basic operations such as traversal, insertion, deletion, and sorting algorithms.
Examples: Sorting algorithms (quick sort, merge sort), searching algorithms (binary search, linear search).
Linked Lists
Description: Linked lists consist of nodes where each node points to the next, allowing efficient insertions and deletions. This section explores singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, and circular linked lists.
Examples: Basic operations (insertion, deletion), traversal, reversing the list.
Strings
Description: Strings are sequences of characters. This section includes algorithms for manipulating and analyzing strings, such as pattern matching and substring searching.
Examples: String matching algorithms (KMP, Rabin-Karp), common operations (reversing, substring extraction).
Mathematics
Description: This category includes algorithms and data structures related to mathematical computations. Topics cover basic arithmetic operations, number theory, and combinatorial algorithms.
Examples: Prime number generation, greatest common divisor (GCD), Fibonacci sequence computation.
